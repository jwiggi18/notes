# Python control flow: conditional logic
## if, elif, else <- are all python [keywords](https://realpython.com/python-keywords/)  
  
## `if` starts a conditional statement  
in spoken language a conditional statement looks something like:  
"If my alarm goes off I will make it on time."  
It is assumed that if my alarm doesn't go off I will not make it on time.  
Syntax:
```{python eval=FALSE}
#imaginary example relating the statement above 
if alarm_goes_off: #TRUE or FALSE
  will_be_on_time #if TRUE statement is executed; if FALSE statement is skipped
  

#what is happening
if what_to_evaluate: #semicolon
  return output #indented


```
There must be a semicolon after `what_to_do`  
  and the next line must be indented  
  
A few examples:
```{python}
a = 10
b = 5

if a > b: #statement is TRUE
  print('yes') #action is executed
  
if a == b: #statement is FALSE
  print('yes') #action is skipped (not executed)
```
This is confusing, which statement produced the 'yes'?  
To clarify add `else`  

## `else` is executed if all other statements are false. It has no conditional
```{python}
a = 10
b = 5

if a == b: #statement is FALSE
  print('yes') #action is skipped (not executed)
else: 
  print('no')
```
use `f-strings` to print to the screen
```{python}
MIN_DRIVING_AGE = 18
if age >= MIN_DRIVING_AGE:
  print(f'{name} is allowed to drive')
else: 
  print(f'{name} is not allowed to drive')
```

## `elif` can only be used after an `if` statement and can be used as many times as needed  
```{python eval=FALSE}
if what_to_evaluate: #semicolon here too
  return output 
elif evaluate_something_else: #semicolon here too
  return different_output


```

`elif` Example:
```{python}
letter = 'b'

if letter == 'a': #semicolon
  print('Aardvark')
elif letter == 'b': #semicolon
  print('Baboon')
elif letter == 'c': #semicolon
  print('Caracal')

```
