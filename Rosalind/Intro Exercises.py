problem
Given: Two positive integers a and b, each less than 1000.

Return: The integer corresponding to the square of the hypotenuse of the right triangle whose legs have lengths a and b.

#hypotenuse calc c = sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
#to get sqrt would:
#from math import sqrt
#import this
#c = sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
#then square c, which is undoing the sqrt

#to get problem answer simply
