## Python Iteration
iteration - a set of instructions is repeated until a specific condition is met  
loop - a block of code the will repeat over and over again  
  
  
### `for` loop
Uses keywords `for` and `in`  
Syntax:
```{python eval=FALSE}
for item in containter:
  do_something

```

Example:
```{python}
animals = ["Dog", "Cat", "Cow"] #container
for animal in animals: #item is defined in the for loop
  print(f"{animal} was here.") #not sure why the 'f' is necessary?
  
  
```

### `while` loop
As long as the condition that follows `while` is TRUE the loop will be continuously executed
```{python eval=FALSE}
while condition:
  do_something
  
  
```

> The code below will produce an infinate loop! If you run it `^Ctrl` + `C` to escape (or maybe just don't run it)

```{python eval=FALSE}
while True:
  print("working...")
  
```

### `break` to exit a loop
```{python eval=FALSE}
for item in container:
  if thing_happens:
    break #exit the loop
  
```

Example:
```{python}
str = ["G", "C", "A", "G", "C", "A", "G", "C", "A", "T", "A"]

for letter in str:
  print(letter)
  if letter == "T":
    break


  
```
The last "A" isn't printed because the loop stopped after encountering a "T"

### `continue`
if the `continue` keyword is reached in a loop the current iteration is stopped and the next is started
```{python eval=FALSE}
for item in container:
  if thing_happens:
    continue #go to the next iteration
  do_a_thing
  
  
```

Example:
```{python}
for l in 'spayed': #using 'l' here for the item instead of 'letter'
  if l == 'y': #if a 'y' is encountered upon iteration
    continue #go do the next thing
  print(l)
  
  
```
The result is printing 'spaed' instead of 'spayed'  
  
### `else` in loops 
`else` is executed when the loop exhausts the list (`for` loops) or when a condition is false (`while` loops) but not when the loop is terminated by `break`.
Syntax

```{python eval=FALSE}
for item in container:
  do_a_thing
else: #belongs to the for loop, there is no if statement
  do_a_different_thing
  
  
```

```{python}
for n in range(2, 10):
  for x in range(2,n):
    if n % x == 0: #modulo returns the remainder of dividing two numbers
      print(n, 'equals', x, '*', n//x)
      break
  else: 
    print(n, 'is a prime number')
    
```
